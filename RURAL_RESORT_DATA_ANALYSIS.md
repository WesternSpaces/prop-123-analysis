## Income Distribution & AMI Data

### Counties with Highest Proportions at 80% AMI or Below

1. **Archuleta County**: 40.7% of households
   - 9.4% extremely low income (≤30% AMI)
   - 10.9% very low income (31-50% AMI)
   - 20.4% low income (51-80% AMI)

2. **La Plata County (Durango)**: 40.1% of households
   - 10.3% extremely low income
   - 12.6% very low income
   - 17.2% low income

3. **Chaffee County**: 37.6% of households
   - 11.2% extremely low income
   - 10.8% very low income
   - 15.6% low income

### The Missing Middle Problem

In most rural resort counties:
- **35-45% of households earn 80% AMI or below**
- **Yet median home values range from $400K to $1.1M**
- **Median rents range from $1,076 to $2,032**

This creates the "missing middle" where:
- People earning 60-100% AMI make "too much" for traditional affordable housing
- But cannot afford market-rate housing in their own communities
- Current Prop 123 limits (60% rental / 100% ownership) exclude most essential workers

## Critical Insights for Prop 123 Analysis

### 1. The Seasonal Housing Problem
- **43,894 units** (27.6% of all housing) are seasonal/recreational
- These units are **unavailable to the workforce** despite high vacancy rates
- Grand, Hinsdale, Lake counties: ~90% of vacant units are seasonal

### 2. Affordability Mismatch
- Counties with **highest median incomes** ($100K+) still have severe affordability crises
- Median home values are **7-11x median household income**
- Even "affordable" units at 120% AMI sit vacant because workers still can't afford them

### 3. The Weighted Average Catch-22
Current petition process requires weighted average AMI calculation:
- Counties have both **very low-income** (30-50% AMI) and **missing middle** (60-140% AMI) needs
- Averaging these together may not show high enough weighted average
- This **prevents access to higher AMI limits** even with documented workforce crisis

### 4. Cost Burden is Severe
- Up to **29.5% of renters** paying >50% of income for housing
- This is **double the HUD definition** of severe cost burden
- Affects all income levels, not just low-income households

### 5. Limited Supply vs. High Vacancy
- **Only 6,221 units** available for rent/sale across all 13 counties
- Yet **55,421 units are vacant** (9x more vacant units than available)
- The problem is not total vacancy, but **availability of year-round workforce housing**

## Implications for Prop 123 Policy

### Why Current AMI Limits Fail Rural Resort Counties

1. **60% AMI rental limit** excludes teachers, nurses, service workers
2. **100% AMI ownership limit** excludes most essential workers
3. **Weighted average requirement** creates mathematical barrier
4. **AMI calculation includes** investment income and wealthy retirees, skewing limits upward
5. **Volatile AMI fluctuations** create moving targets (e.g., Routt County: 50% AMI jump 2020-2025)

### Data Supports Policy Recommendations

The data clearly demonstrates:
1. All 12 rural resort counties face **similar structural challenges**
2. Standard AMI limits are **fundamentally mismatched** to workforce housing needs
3. High vacancy rates do **not translate to available workforce housing**
4. Counties with documented crises may **fail weighted average test**
5. Petition process is **unnecessarily burdensome** for small mountain communities
