## The Disparity Problem

### Demand vs Supply
- **113 applications** requesting **$255+ million**
- Only **$25.3 million** available (first land banking)
- **Selection rate: 14%**
- Over **230 local governments** opted in

### Why Rural Areas Lost Out

**Capacity Issues:**
- Smaller staffs, less grant-writing expertise
- Limited matching fund capacity
- Fewer "shovel-ready" projects

**AMI Problems:**
- Wealthy second-home owners skew income data
- Small populations with extreme disparities
- Higher costs but same/lower income limits

**Competition Criteria:**
- "Readiness to proceed" favors urban areas
- Financial feasibility harder for rural projects
- Geographic distribution not primary factor

## Bottom Line

**The disparity is real and significant:**

- Front Range metros received **3-5x larger** individual awards
- Rural resort counties got **16.8%** of funding despite representing ~50% of state geography
- **9 of 14** rural resort counties received **zero** development funding
- Average Front Range award: **$3.5M** vs Rural Resort: **$1M**
- Structural barriers favor urban "ready" projects over rural need

**Exception:** Grand County received exceptional funding ($14.5M) due to one large equity award to Fraser, but this is the exception proving the rule - most rural resort counties received little or nothing.
