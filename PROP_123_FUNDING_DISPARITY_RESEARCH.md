## ANALYSIS: DISPARITY FACTORS & CHALLENGES

### 1. Structural Challenges for Rural Areas

**Capacity Issues:**
- Rural governments have less funding for application development
- Fewer staff with grant writing expertise
- Limited ability to provide matching funds
- Smaller organizational capacity of local housing authorities

**Development Economics:**
- Lower salaries in rural areas reduce AMI calculations
- Smaller populations make projects less economically viable
- Higher per-unit construction costs in remote locations
- Limited local contractor availability

### 2. Area Median Income (AMI) Problems

**Rural Resort County Specific Issues:**
- Small populations with extreme income disparities
- Wealthy second-home owners skew median income data upward
- Higher local AMI limits make qualifying residents ineligible
- Cost of living much higher than state/national averages

**Legislative Response:**
- HB23-1304 allows rural resort communities to petition for up to 140% AMI limits
- Requires updated housing needs assessment
- Fraser successfully petitioned for raised income limits

### 3. Demand vs. Supply

**Overwhelming Demand:**
- 113 Letters of Intent for $255+ million in funding
- Only $25.3 million available in first land banking round
- Over 230 local governments opted in
- Funds "far over prescribed for what demand is requesting" - Peter Lifari, Maiker Housing Partners

**Competition Disadvantages for Rural:**
- Selection criteria favor "readiness to proceed"
- Urban areas have more prepared projects
- Geographic distribution considered but not primary factor
- Financial feasibility harder to demonstrate in rural areas

### 4. Opposition & Concerns

**Club 20 (Mountain & Western Slope Counties):**
- Opposed Proposition 123 during ballot campaign
- Executive Director Brittany Dixon cited structural disadvantages
- Concerns about equitable distribution to rural areas

**Opt-In Challenges:**
- Not all rural counties opted in
- 3% annual affordable housing growth requirement difficult for small counties
- Some governments chose not to participate

## REPORTED IMPACTS & QUOTES

### Rural Resort Areas

**Yampa Valley Housing Authority (Steamboat/Routt County):**
> "It's a really direct benefit in that it allows us to sell units at a lower price point."

**Town of Fraser:**
> St. Louis Landing Phase I will include purpose-built Early Childhood Learning Center, serving residents 30%-120% AMI

**Eagle County:**
> Housing authority planning to apply for West Eagle project with 100+ below-market units

### Statewide Distribution

**Total to Rural/Resort Counties (First Round):**
> "Of the $160 million that was available during the first round of funding, $26.9 million was issued by the housing authority for development projects in rural and resort counties across the western half of the state."

This represents only **16.8%** of total first-round funding going to rural and resort counties.

---

## POLICY & STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### Club 20's Opposition Points
- Funding structure favors Front Range metros
- Rural areas have systemic disadvantages
- AMI calculations don't reflect rural resort realities
- Insufficient safeguards for geographic equity

### Common Sense Institute Analysis
- Noted opt-in loophole allows governments to decline participation
- Warned of uneven distribution if participation weak
- Identified that "Coloradans who voted for the measure could be on the outside looking in"
- Highlighted oversupply of demand vs. available funding

### Bell Policy Center Findings
- Central tension around AMI targeting for rural vs. urban vs. resort communities
- Rural mountain counties have highest rates of investment/second-home purchases
- Routt County: 47% of loans for second homes (2019)
- Front Range housing shortage outpacing rural in absolute numbers

## CONCLUSION

The data reveals a significant disparity in Proposition 123 first-round funding distribution between Front Range urban areas and rural/rural resort counties:

1. **Funding Volume:** Front Range metros received substantially larger total awards and individual project funding
2. **Project Count:** More projects funded in urban areas despite geographic distribution goals
3. **Rural Resort Gaps:** 9 of the 13 designated rural resort counties received no identified first-round awards
4. **Structural Barriers:** Rural areas face capacity, economic, and AMI calculation disadvantages
5. **Demand Competition:** Over $255M in requests for $25M in land banking funds creates intense competition favoring "ready" urban projects

While notable exceptions exist (Fraser's $12.9M award, Frisco's $5M), the overall pattern shows Front Range concentration of funding despite statewide need and rural resort communities facing some of Colorado's most severe affordable housing crises.

The 16.8% allocation to rural and resort counties (representing roughly half of Colorado's geographic area) suggests systemic barriers that may require policy intervention beyond the existing AMI petition process to achieve more equitable distribution.
